PS D:\broot> .\broot.exe

Broot should be launched using a shell function.
This function most notably makes it possible to cd from inside broot
(see https://dystroy.org/broot/install-br/ for explanations).

Can I install it now? [Y/n]

The br function has been successfully installed.
You may have to restart your shell or source your shell init files.
Afterwards, you should start broot with br in order to use its full power
